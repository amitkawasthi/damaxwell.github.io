\hproblem 
In this problem, we will seek a solution to the initial value problem
\begin{align*}
f'(t) &= F(t,f(t))\\
f(0) &= a
\end{align*}
where $F:\Reals^2\ra \Reals$ and $a\in\Reals$.

To obtain the existence result, we need to assume that $F$ is sufficiently nice;
we will assume that $F$ is continuous, and moreover that there exists a constant $K$
such that
$$
|F(x,y_1)-F(x,y_2)|\le K |y_1-y_2|
$$
for all $x,y_1,y_2\in\Reals$.

Define $G:C[-T,T]\ra C[-T,T]$ by
$$
G(f)(t) = a + \int_0^t F(s,f(s))\; ds.
$$

\begin{subproblems}
\item Explain why $G(f)\in C[-T,T]$ if $f\in C[-T,T]$.
\item Show that if $f$ solves the initial value problem for $t\in[-T,T]$, then $G(f)=f$.
\item Show that $G$ is Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant $TK$.
\item Assuming $T<1/K$, show that there exists a solution of $G(f)=f$
defined for $t\in [-T,T]$.
You may use the fact that $C[-T,T]$ is complete; we'll show this later.
\item Assuming $T<1/K$, show that there exists a unique solution
of the initial value problem defined on $(-T,T)$.
\item Extra credit:  Show that there exists a solution $f$ of the initial value problem
defined for all $t\in\Reals$.
