\hproblem Suppose $E\subseteq \Reals$.  Prove that $E$ is measurable
if and only if for any $\epsilon>0$ there is an open set $G$ and a closed 
set $F$ such that $F\subseteq E\subseteq G$ and $m^*(G\setminus F)<\epsilon$.
(This is your text's definition of measurability.)

\hproblem Revisit 16.28 using the full power of the theorems we've developed for
Lebesgue measure.  That is, try to come up with a tidy short proof that $m(\Delta_\alpha)=\alpha$.
